I have decided to only include the scripts, scenes, prefabs, and sprite directories in the repository to reduce clutter. These can be found in the Assets directory.

### Scripts
- Contains the scripts written in C# that controls the logics and functionalities of the application.
- In the GeneratedToy.cs file, the api key is removed for privacy reasons.

### Scenes
- Contains the unity scene file for each level/environment for the application.
  
### Prefabs
- Contains the animator, assets and models configured to be used in the application.
  
### Sprite
- Contains the images used for the buttons.
